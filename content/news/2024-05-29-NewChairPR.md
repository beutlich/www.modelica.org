**New Modelica Association Chair elected -   
Dr. Dirk Zimmer succeeds Prof. Dr.-Ing. Martin Otter**

At the annual assembly meeting of the international Modelica Association on May 28, 2024, Dirk Zimmer was elected as the new Chair. He succeeds Martin Otter, who held the position since the foundation of the Modelica Association in 2000.

Martin Otter was one of the main designers of the Modelica Language and the Modelica Standard library. Modelica is a non-proprietary, object-oriented, equation-based language to model complex physical systems containing, e.g., mechanical, electrical, electronic, hydraulic, thermal, control, electric power or process-oriented subcomponents. Additionally, he was one of the main developers of the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI), a free standard that defines a container and an interface to exchange dynamic simulation models using a combination of XML files, binaries and C code, distributed as a ZIP file. It is supported by 200+ tools and maintained as a Modelica Association Project.

*“I am very pleased to hand over the Chair position of the Modelica Association to Dirk Zimmer. He is a recognized expert in the field of modeling and simulation with many contributions and new ideas, such as his innovative approach to model complex thermo-fluid systems with Modelica that can be robustly simulated. I am confident that he will lead the Modelica Association in an excellent way, helping to further develop and promote the Modelica Association’s open standards and open source software, especially with benefit for industry. On a personal note, I wish Dirk all the best in this new endeavor and look forward to the continued growth of the Modelica Association under his leadership.***”***  
Prof. Dr.-Ing Martin Otter, DLR*

“*It is a great honor for me to take over the leadership of the Modelica Association. In 25 years of relentless work, Prof. Otter has helped to create a community that is now a productive home for engineers and researchers all over the world. His insatiable curiosity for modern technical solutions ensured that Modelica and FMI became industry-leading tools. It is more than just a duty to preserve this legacy; it will be also a great pleasure to face new challenges so that Modelica and FMI increase their world-wide benefit to education, research and industry. I wish Martin Otter all the best for his future and I am very happy to still have him on the board of the Modelica Association in his new role as Technology officer. “  
Dr. Dirk Zimmer, DLR*

## Prof. Dr.-Ing. Martin Otter

Martin Otter is currently acting director of the DLR Institute of System Dynamics and Control, having served as deputy director since 2014. He studied mechanical engineering at the Technical University of Munich, received his PhD (Dr.-Ing.) with an award of excellence from the Ruhr University Bochum in 1994, supervised more than 20 dissertations and has published more than 170 scientific papers. Since 2000, Martin Otter has been the Chair of the international Modelica Association. For 20 years he has been an honorary professor at the Technical University of Munich, where he teaches a course on modeling and simulation since 1997.

### Dr. Dirk Zimmer

Dirk Zimmer is the coordinator for Methods and Tools at the DLR Institute of System Dynamics and Control. He received his PhD at the Department of Computer Science of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETH) with an award of excellence in 2010. As multiple winner of the Modelica library award, he contributed to the Open Source community and as former leader of the team aircraft energy systems, he devised novel solutions for the modeling of thermal fluid systems. Dirk Zimmer is actively teaching Modeling & Simulation in general and Modelica in particular through his roles as guest lecturer at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) and the University of Applied Sciences Vorarlberg.

About the Modelica Association

The Modelica Association (MA) is a non-profit organization incorporated in Sweden with the mission to develop open-access, royalty-free, coordinated standards for the development and verification of cyber-physical systems. The open and royalty-free nature of the standards supports a rich ecosystem of open source and commercial solutions. The MA projects provide open source assets, compliance checkers, and infrastructure to simplify the process of standards adoption, all publicly available under the Modelica GitHub organization, and organizes regular open access conferences, with all papers available on the Modelica website. The Modelica Association standards are endorsed and recommended by many professional societies in the modeling and systems engineering domain: Prostep IVIP, PDES, NAFEMS, and INCOSE.
