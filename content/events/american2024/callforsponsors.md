## Call for Sponsors

As the organizing committee for the 2024 American Modelica Conference, the board of the North American Modelica Users’ Group would like to invite you to participate in the next iteration of this conference as a Gold or Silver sponsor.  One of the most engaging characteristics of Modelica conferences is the close interaction between users and solution and tool vendors, which provide each other with information and new perspectives on opportunities and approaches in using Modelica and FMI technologies.  The participation of sponsors in the conference enables such interactions and makes the conference possible.  

This page describes the benefits of these sponsorship levels, which include representation in the conference program, participation in our exhibition space, and an allocation of free registrations.  

Gold sponsorship includes the following benefits: 

1.	A ½ page vendor abstract in the program, 
1.	A ¼ page advertisement in the program,
1.	A conference booth in the exhibition space,
1.	2 free registrations to the conference (including the conference dinner), and 
1.	Logos in the printed program and website.

Silver sponsorship includes the following benefits:

1.	A ¼ page advertisement in the program,
1.	A conference booth in the exhibition space,
1.	1 free registration to the conference (including the conference dinner), and
1.	Logos in the printed program and website.

Examples of both the vendor abstracts and ads can be found in the program for the 2022 American Modelica Conference, which can be viewed [here](https://2022.american.conference.modelica.org/Schedule.html).  These vendor abstracts are intended to complement the vendor presentations by including a logo and approximately 400 words of text.  In addition, the different sponsorship levels are accompanied by the ability to place an ad in the program.  

The cost of these sponsorship levels is commensurate with the accompanying benefits: the price for the Gold sponsorship is $1500, while the cost of the Silver sponsorship is $1000.  These sponsorships can be purchased via a ticket on the conference website at Eventbrite, which will be opened soon.  

We thank you for your continued support of the Modelica conferences and community in North America, and look forward to seeing you in Storrs, CT.
